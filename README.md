# RC Labs

## 1. Wall Follower
Use a PD controller to keep the RC car a fixed distance from the wall.

## 2. Turn Radius
Determine the turn radius of the car using Ackermann dynamics, and adjust it based on experimental data.

## 3. Pure Pursuit
Use the pure pursuit algorithm to have the RC car go to a specified waypoint.

## 4. RRT
Perform RRT search on a map saved from driving the car around a real obstacle course.
